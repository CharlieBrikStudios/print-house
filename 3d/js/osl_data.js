// Oldham Street Lofts, Syddall Street, Hyde SK14 1LB (Ollier Smurthwaite Architects, planning 24/00783/FUL): nine
// three-bedroom townhouses (plots 1–9) and fifteen one-bedroom apartments (plots 10–24) in a three-storey red-brick
// mill-style block on the corner of Oldham Street. Prices from the Brik Studios accommodation schedule (October 2026).
// Plan frame (the GA sheets): s runs along Syddall Street from Henry Street (west) to Oldham Street (east), t runs back
// from the Syddall Street frontage into the site. Footprints are stored as [u0, v0, u1, v1] with u = s and v = -t, the
// convention the engine uses for plan-frame buildings (local x = u, local z = -v).
